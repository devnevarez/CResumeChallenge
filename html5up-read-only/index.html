										<h2>Professional Summary</h2>
										<p>Experienced collaborator with a versatile skill set.<br />
										</p>
									</header><br />
									
									<p>Equipped with a burning desire to succeed as a young professional,
										I completed my first career change when I left the hospitality industry. After graduating from UNLV with a Bachelors in Criminal Justice I was hired on as Corrections Officer with the State of Nevada. 
										What excited me about the law enforcement field as fledgling graduate were the learning opportunities to resolve arguements with clear and collected responses.
										I remember a time during my tenure as a Corrections Officer, I was in training and was partnered with an Officer fresh-out of the academy. We were to work within the worst unit of the yard, and to make matters worse the inmates were
										not happy; all 192 of them. As it turned out before our shift began, there had been an incident at the prisons gym. This incident caused their gym time to be shortened and when the unit got back, accusations were being yelled at between rivaling gangs. The freshly appointed Officer
										and I looked at each other and quickly discussed ways to de-escalate the situation. Since I did not know how to control the units gates which locked down each of its three halls, I was to go out with a speakerphone to yell over the cacophony and attempt to round up the unit. 64 people at a time.<br><br>
										I was able to get the first hall of rowdy prisoners inside their holding areas and was working on the second hall when the obnoxiously loud unit let out a horrifying shriek. The noise turned out to be coming from the radio I had on my person and was activated by my partner controlling the gates at the center
										of the unit. During the time I had no idea why he activated the emergency alarm, so while working on getting stragglers of the second hall inside their holding areas I worked my way to the center. When all of a sudden the hallway gate started shutting in front of me. I was only half way through the hall
										when this happened. I could not believe what was happening, I was being locked in with at least 20 livid inmates during an emergency.<br><br> 
										With a million thoughts racing in my head, a speakerphone, and a radio at my hip I realized it was up to me to get 
										out of this horrible situation. I looked at the other inmates still out of their cells and they looked at me, now a prisoner within their realm. At this time I stopped using the speakerphone and found my "CO Voice", a term referring to the ability to project authority and get your point across. For
										a reason I would learn later on, the inmates respected me more for this. At the face of adversity I overcame it with creativity and a new approach. While not being as loud as the speakerphone, my words were clearer than ever.<br><br>
										With the rest of the hall locked down I finally made it to the gate were I could finally see what had caused the emergency. There was blood in the center of the unit and it was caused by a fight that had transpired during my time of captivity. I could see
										my partner within the protected area of the housing unit, not realizing he had locked me in along with 64 other inmates. An emergency team of Correction Officers had arrived to the unit and seperated the fight that occured, when they saw me behind the gate they had nothing to say
										as they were probably as dumbfounded as me to see one of their own locked behind a gate during a full-blown riot.<br><br> 
										The next day they were surprised to see me come back after what had happened, they let me know my previous partner had had enough. I was also surprised to hear this as I was new,
										but did not blame the Officer for leaving after what had happened. I went on to complete the academy and would transfer from the prison into Stein Forensic Hospital, a law enforcement holding facility for psychiatric patients who are waiting to be determined mentally competent by the court.
										Here I learned about the significance of mental illness in our population and how it negatively affects behaviour.<br><br> 
										Working as a Forensic Specialist I felt a naivety had been lifted from me and gained an understanding that I wanted to help people by resolving their problems.
										I am still grateful for the de-escalation techniques I learned and the confidence I gained; but nonetheless, I left law enforcement about five years later, after the first year of the pandemic, to become an Independent Field Inspector. 
										Here, I quickly ramped up within a few months to start my first property investigation. <br><br> 
										As a Field Inspector, I had the pleasure of solving complex-problems, by identifying sources of property damage, and documenting my findings in an easily readable format. 
										During my time as a Field Inspector, I engaged in meaningful discussions with customers, contractors, and their insurance agents, working collaboratively to find effective solutions for their claims
										It would come up in conversation that some of the individuals I met were planning on a career change from this industry and nothing motivated them more than burning while crawling on molten granules of a 100+ degree roof. 
										It dawned on me that I also would not be able to climb on roofs to complete investigations for the rest of my life. 
										Not to mention I met my now fiancee during my tenure; where she expressed concerns relating to me being three stories high without having the ability to stick on walls.<br><br>
										I had received offers to work at insurance companies as a property claims adjuster from the relationships I had built. Although I would have the ability to solve issues, what I really want from a career is the opportunity for growth as I continue to learn new skills.
										While working as a field inspector I used an application on my phone that would upload my documents, so that I could review the photos I'd capture and submit reports.
										I remember there was an update to the app that brought about a function that would upload photos in the background and store them in the <em>Cloud</em>. I remember how useful of a feature it was and it made me think about growing up with technology and how far it has progressed. 
										<em>How did we go from 8 bit Marios to Marios blasting off into space? How did our cell phones become small enough to fit in our pockets and then big enough again to look like laptops?</em>
										I began researching IT and quickly found myself in a rabbit hole that I still have yet to climbed out of. <br><br> What I enjoy most about the IT field is you will never stop learning as technology will never stop advancing.
										Within a year I earned my <em>CompTIA A+</em> and <em>Network+</em> along with the <em>Axelos ITIL4 Foundation Best Practices</em> certifications. In the summer of 2023 I was accepted into Per Scholas, within their AWS re/Start program.
										Here I collaborated with colleagues to create presentations on AWS Cloud Services, Linux Administration, and Security best practices. Finally I created this website, guided by the Cloud Resume Project to put some of my newfound skills to use.
										I have learned a lot and have a whole lot more to go. What drives me is a motivation to see myself succeed and grow in this field, just as I have done so before. </p>
