										<h2>Professional Summary</h2>
										<p>Experienced collaborator with a versatile skill set.<br />
										</p>
									</header><br />
									
									<p>Equipped with a burning desire to succeed as a young professional,
										I completed my first career change when I left the hospitality industry to become a corrections officer with the State of Nevada. 
										I invested everything I had into my Bachelors Degree in Criminal Justice. Little did I know, my younger self had a limited understanding of what we ultimately wanted to accomplish in life.
										Eventually I left law enforcement about five years later, after the first year of the Pandemic, to become an independent field inspector. I brought all the de-escalation techniques I learned across the country and completely started over in a new career and new coast. 
										Here, I quickly ramped up within a few months to start my first property investigation. <br><br> As a Field Inspector, I learned I was really good at solving problems; identifying sources of property damage, and explaining my findings in an easily readable format. 
										During my time as a field inspector, I had conversations with customers, contractors, and their insurance agents to collaborate on finding solutions to their claims. 
										Some of these individuals were planning on a career change from this industry and nothing motivated them more than sweating or burning while crawling on molten granules of a 100+ degree roof. 
										It dawned on me that I would not be able to climb on roofs for the rest of my life. It was hard work and my hands were starting to smell like bacon from the searing heat. 
										Not to mention I met my now fiancee during my tenure; where she expressed concerns relating to me being three stories above ground while not having the ability to stick on walls.<br><br>
										Knowing I would change careers again, this time I was determined to sit and think about what I really enjoyed doing. While working as a field inspector I used an application on my phone that would upload my documents, so that I could review the photos I'd take and submit reports.  
										I remember there was an update to the app that brought about a function that would upload photos in the background and store them in the cloud. I remember how useful of a feature it was and it made me think about growing up with technology and how far it has progressed. 
										<em>How did we go from 8 bit Marios to Marios blasting off into space? How did our cell phones become small enough to fit in our pockets and then big enough again to not fit in our pockets?</em>
										I began researching IT and quickly found myself in a rabbit hole that I still have yet to climbed out of. <br><br> What I enjoy most about the IT field is you will never stop learning as technology will never stop advancing.
										Within a year I earned my <em>CompTIA A+</em> and <em>Network+</em> along with the <em>Axelos ITIL4 Foundation Best Practices</em> certifications. In the summer of 2023 I was accepted into Per Scholas, within their AWS re/Start program.
										Here I collaborated with colleagues to create presentations on AWS cloud services, Linux Administration, Bash and Python scripting, Networking, and Security best practices.
										I have learned a lot and have a whole lot more to go. What drives me is a motivation to see myself succeed in this field, just as I have done so before. </p>
